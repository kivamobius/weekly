**十倍效能提升——Web 基础研发体系的建立**  
http://www.cnblogs.com/sskyy/p/8613393.html  
web 基础研发体系指的是， web 研发中一线工程师所直接操作的技术、工具，以及所属组织架构的总和。而我们在实践中发现，在：“互联网渗入到各行各业，业务爆发；企业竞争白热化，对速度和品质要求越来越高；一线工程师队伍越来越庞大，管理成本增高”这样的多重背景下，除了底层核心技术外，一线 web 研发效能的问题也逐渐成为决胜战场的重要因素。然而在现实中我们看到，因为一线的研发工作可替换性强，所以并没有受到足够的重视，同时也缺少更统一、更有深度的规划和管理。实际上，将一线工程师所直接接触到的应用框架、测试、部署、监控等领域作为一个完整的体系来思考，并打造成一体化的基础设施，能为企业的业务研发带来巨大的效能提升。

**精读《Immer.js》源码**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/34691516  
Immer 是最近火起来的一个项目，由 Mobx 作者 Mweststrate 研发。了解 mobx 的同学可能会发现，Immer 就是更底层的 Mobx，它将 Mobx 特性发扬光大，得以结合到任何数据流框架，使用起来非常优雅。

**Unblocking Clipboard Access**  
https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/03/clipboardapi  
That's the new Async Clipboard API, the text-focused portion of which we're shipping in Chrome 66. It's a replacement for execCommand-based copy & paste that has a well-defined permissions model and doesn't block the page. This new API also Promises (see what I did there?) to simplify clipboard events and align them with the Drag & Drop API. 附：[Chrome 66 Beta: CSS Typed Object Model, Async Clipboard API, AudioWorklet](https://blog.chromium.org/2018/03/chrome-66-beta-css-typed-object-model.html)、[WebKit - Clipboard API Improvements](https://webkit.org/blog/8170/clipboard-api-improvements/).

**Announcing gRPC Support in NGINX**  
https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-1-13-10-grpc/   
We’re excited to share the first native support for gRPC traffic within NGINX. If you’re as keen as we are, you can pull the snapshot from our repository and share your feedback.

The next NGINX Plus release, R15, will include this support for gRPC as well as the support for HTTP/2 server push support introduced in NGINX 1.13.9. 另附：[gRPC Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uolTUtioIrc)

**“Write once, use everywhere” is an anti-pattern**  
https://hackernoon.com/write-once-run-everywhere-is-an-anti-pattern-2e32e1dd5b93  
The problem at its core is that each platform has its own unique strengths that are often diminished or even completely eliminated by heavy abstractions. That doesn’t mean multi-platform development is bad. It’s just that (in most cases) it makes more sense to follow a slightly different approach. One that focuses more on building multi-platform products instead of multi-platform apps.

**AMP: The web’s first steps into the Performance Age**  
https://uxplanet.org/amp-the-webs-first-steps-into-the-performance-age-8a25ba2f35f2  
Google’s Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) have driven a renewed focus on web performance, bringing with them a change in user expectation that will topple the foundations of Responsive Web Design. What factors led to the rise of AMP and how will web design change as we enter this new age of performance?

https://www.joeforshaw.com/blog/css-the-bad-bits-and-how-to-avoid-them  
As difficult as I believe CSS is, every website in the world needs it and couldn’t survive without it. So here’s some of my thoughts on what’s bad and how to keep sane when writing it. It’s going to be a working list, so anything else that bugs me in the future will get tacked onto the end.

**LinkedIn Lite: A Lightweight Mobile Web Experience**  
https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2018/03/linkedin-lite--a-lightweight-mobile-web-experience  
One of the most important factors for Lite’s success is that we analyzed the bottlenecks in the mobile application in India and made them the core tenets to architect a system that would not suffer the same problems. It involved working with the infrastructure teams and also understanding the entire stack from the ground up before deciding on an architecture, rather than relying on a magic sauce to solve our problems.

**Introducing QALM, Uber’s QoS Load Management Framework**  
https://eng.uber.com/qalm/  
To proactively manage our traffic loads based on the criticality of requests, we built QoS Aware Load Management (QALM), a dynamic load shedding framework for incoming requests based on criticality. When the service degrades due to traffic overload, resource exhaustion, or dependency failure, QALM prioritizes server resources for more critical requests and sheds less critical ones. Our goal with QALM is to reduce the frequency and severity of any outages or incidents, leading to more reliable user experiences across our business.

**Announcing Microsoft DirectX Raytracing!**  
https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/directx/2018/03/19/announcing-microsoft-directx-raytracing/  
We are introducing a feature to DirectX 12 that will bridge the gap between the rasterization techniques employed by games today, and the full 3D effects of tomorrow.  This feature is DirectX Raytracing.  By allowing traversal of a full 3D representation of the game world, DirectX Raytracing allows current rendering techniques such as SSR to naturally and efficiently fill the gaps left by rasterization, and opens the door to an entirely new class of techniques that have never been achieved in a real-time game. Readers unfamiliar with rasterization and raytracing will find more information about the basics of these concepts in the appendix below.
