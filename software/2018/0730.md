Node.js version 8 shipped with this new and improved version of V8, which means we can finally write idiomatic and declarative JavaScript without worrying about incurring performance overhead due to compiler shortcomings. At least, this is what the V8 team tells us.

**A one year PWA retrospective**  
https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering/a-one-year-pwa-retrospective-f4a2f4129e05  
One year ago (July, 2017) we brought a team together to rewrite our mobile website from scratch as a PWA. This was the culmination of several years of conversation, months of metrics investigation and one large hypothesis: mobile web can be as good as a native app. The results are quite…pinteresting. 另附：[PWACompat: the Web App Manifest for all browsers](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/07/pwacompat).

**美团服务体验平台对接业务数据的最佳实践**  
https://tech.meituan.com/sep_service_arrange.html  
移动互联网时代，用户体验为王。美团服务体验平台希望能够帮助客户解决在选、购、用美团产品过程中遇到的各种问题，真正做到“以客户为中心”，为客户排忧解难。但服务体验平台内部只维护客户的客诉数据，为了精准地预判和更好地解决客户遇到的问题，系统必须依赖业务部门提供的一些业务数据，包括但不限于订单数据、退款数据、产品数据等等。本文会着重讲一下在整个系统交互过程中遇到的一些问题，然后分享一下在实践中探索出来的经验和方法论，希望能够给大家带来一些启发。

In this blog post we are going to outline some of the key features of QUIC and how they benefit the web, and also some of the challenges of supporting this radical new protocol.

**Why Discord is Sticking with React Native**  
https://blog.discordapp.com/why-discord-is-sticking-with-react-native-ccc34be0d427  
Looking back at the past three years, React Native has proven to be extremely successful at Discord and helped drive our iOS user adoption from zero to millions! More specifically, React Native has allowed us to reap the benefits of quickly leveraging reusable code across platforms, as well as develop a small and mighty team. Meanwhile, we’ve learned to adapt to its inevitable pain points without sacrificing overall productivity. 另附：[Hunting JS memory leaks in React Native apps](https://blog.swmansion.com/hunting-js-memory-leaks-in-react-native-apps-bd73807d0fde).

**Is WebAssembly the return of Java Applets & Flash?**  
https://words.steveklabnik.com/is-webassembly-the-return-of-java-applets-flash  
One thing I’ll say about this post is that it’s quite implementer focused. But implementers are important; they control the web. Providing a solution that works with their goals is just as important as something that works for users. In a future post, I’d like to try to go over user concerns some as well. I have lots of posts to write!

**Backblaze Durability is 99.999999999% — And Why It Doesn’t Matter**  
https://www.backblaze.com/blog/cloud-storage-durability/  
In the same spirit of transparency that leads us to publish our hard drive performance stats, open source our Reed-Solomon Erasure Code, and generally try to share as much of our underlying architecture as practical, we’d like to share our calculations for the durability of data stored with us. We are doing this for two reasons: We believe that sharing, where practical, furthers innovation in the community.
Transparency breeds trust; We’re in the business of asking customers to trust us with their data. It seems reasonable to demonstrate why we’re worthy of your trust.

**Be Nice And Write Stable Code**  
http://technosophos.com/2018/07/04/be-nice-and-write-stable-code.html  
The professional software developer has long-term usability and stability as a goal. Yes, well-architected code is important. But there is a time and place for making that your focus. And maintenance releases (minor and patch versions) are not an occasion to refactor, re-organize, or make sweeping modifications. Be conscientious about how much effort the users of your code put into using your code. I can tell you from experience what we do when the maintenance burden you impose on us gets wearying: We stop using your tools (or we fork them). SemVer is a communications tool. But to use it well, we must use it accurately. And that means writing code focused on stability.

**Developer Roadmaps**  
https://css-tricks.com/developer-roadmaps/  
The path to becoming a front-end developer, as looked back upon by anyone who self-identifies that way, is likely a very windy one full of thorn bushes and band websites. Still, documenting a path, even if it's straighter and far cleaner than reality, is an interesting exercise and might just be valuable. Three different writer/developers have taken a crack at it this year and their results have been extraordinarily popular. Let's take a look. 另附：[前端读书路线图：从入门到编写框架](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5Mjg4NDMwMA==&mid=2652975987&idx=1&sn=1868310f606ab678f533040c366d6e20).

**Stop letting the data decide**  
http://www.nielshoven.com/stop-letting-the-data-decide/  
When products are built iteratively, with decisions made primarily through testing and iteration, there’s no guarantee of a consistent vision. Some teams take pride in the fact that their roadmaps only extend a week into the future. “Our tests will tell us what direction to go next!” Data-informed design helps your product tell a consistent story. This is the power of a cohesive product vision. It can be hard to explain exactly WHY a cohesive product vision translates to a better product, and also why it’s so hard to get there purely by data-driven iteration. Perhaps an extremely contrived example can help illustrate my point. 另附：[Show me the data](https://blog.prototypr.io/https-unsplash-com-photos-kmsla6qb6uk-utm-source-unsplash-utm-medium-referral-utm-content-creditco-47f93e7195af)

https://uxdesign.cc/how-airbnb-proved-that-storytelling-is-the-most-important-skill-in-design-15d04ac71039  
Every business breakthrough starts with a story, from a customer’s pain point or, like in the case of Airbnb, a story about a particularly excellent experience a customer once had. Most designers or entrepreneurs strive for product innovations with wireframes or product sketches.
