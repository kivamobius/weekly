========  

## 深阅读

**React Fire: Modernizing React DOM**  
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13525  
As this work is getting closer to completion, we're starting to think of what the next major releases of React DOM should look like. There are quite a few known problems, and some of them are hard or impossible to fix without bigger internal changes. We want to undo past mistakes that caused countless follow-up fixes and created much technical debt. We also want to remove some of the abstraction in the event system which has been virtually untouched since the first days of React, and is a source of much complexity and bundle size. We're calling this effort "React Fire”.

**Babel 7 Released**  
https://babeljs.io/blog/2018/08/27/7.0.0  
After almost 2 years, 4k commits, over 50 pre-releases, and a lot of help we are excited to announce the release of Babel 7. It's been almost 3 years since the release of Babel 6! There's a lot of moving parts so please bear with us in the first weeks of release. Babel 7 is a huge release: we've made it faster, created an upgrade tool, JS configs, config "overrides", more options for size/minification, JSX Fragments, TypeScript, new proposals, and more! 另附：[babel-upgrade: A New Tool for Automtically Upgrading Projects to Babel 7](https://github.com/babel/babel-upgrade)、 [What’s Coming Up in JavaScript 2018: Async Generators, Better Regex](https://thenewstack.io/whats-coming-up-in-javascript-2018-async-generators-better-regex/)、 [Through the Open Source Looking Glass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0sfFX7WH1c): A non-technical talk by Babel maintainer Henry Zhu about what it’s like and what it means to be the maintainer of popular open source projects.

**Flutter Platform Channels**  
https://medium.com/flutter-io/flutter-platform-channels-ce7f540a104e  
Flutter invites you to write your mobile app in the Dart programming language and build for both Android and iOS. But Dart does not compile to Android’s Dalvik bytecode, nor are you blessed with Dart/Objective-C bindings on iOS. This means that your Dart code is written without direct access to the platform-specific APIs of iOS Cocoa Touch and the Android SDK. 另附：[What We’ve Learned from the July 2018 Flutter User Survey](https://medium.com/flutter-io/what-weve-learned-from-the-july-2018-flutter-user-survey-cbbf1e04370c)

**前端性能优化：2018年JavaScript开销及优化工具和方法**  
https://juejin.im/entry/5b849efde51d4538e018f90c  
现代前端开发中性能瓶颈依然在于JavaScript，而且前端项目中JavaScript开销越来越大。本文详细介绍了 JavaScript 开销及原因，更是给出了相应的前端性能优化工具和方法。文章有点长，但是相信你可以获得很多有用的信息。另附：[Front-End Performance Checklist](https://github.com/thedaviddias/Front-End-Performance-Checklist).

**Conversational Semantics**  
https://alistapart.com/article/conversational-semantics  
As Alexa, Cortana, Siri, and even customer support chat bots become the norm, we have to start carefully considering not only how our content looks but how it could sound. We can—and should—use HTML and ARIA to make our content structured, sensible, and most importantly, meaningful.

**Super-Powered Grid Components with CSS Custom Properties**  
https://css-tricks.com/super-power-grid-components-with-css-custom-properties/  
Grid is neither a substitute for flexbox nor vice versa. In fact, using a combination of the two gives us even more power when building components.

**Programmatically create images with the CSS Paint API**  
https://www.sitepen.com/blog/2018/08/27/programmatically-create-images-with-the-css-paint-api/  
The CSS Paint API is a modern web platform feature to programmatically create images in JavaScript which are rendered to the page when referenced by CSS. You create images using the Canvas API, an API with which you may already be familiar.

**Dweb: Building Cooperation and Trust into the Web with IPFS**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/08/dweb-building-cooperation-and-trust-into-the-web-with-ipfs/  
In this series we are covering projects that explore what is possible when the web becomes decentralized or distributed. These projects aren’t affiliated with Mozilla, and some of them rewrite the rules of how we think about a web browser. What they have in common: These projects are open source, and open for participation, and share Mozilla’s mission to keep the web open and accessible for all.

**Why is a Java guy so excited about Node.js and JavaScript?**  
https://blog.sourcerer.io/why-is-a-java-guy-so-excited-about-node-js-and-javascript-7cfc423efb44  
Shouldn’t someone who worked 10+ years in the Java SE team at Sun Microsystems bleed Java bytecodes and be instantiating abstract interfaces until the last breath? For this former Java SE team member, learning the Node.js platform in 2011 was a breath of fresh air. After being laid off from Sun in January 2009 (just prior to the Oracle buyout), I learned about and became hooked on Node.js.

**Node.js and the "HashWick" vulnerability**  
https://nodesource.com/blog/node-js-and-the-hashwick-vulnerability  
This week, veteran Node.js core contributor and former Node.js TSC member Fedor Indutny published an article on his personal blog detailing a newly-discovered vulnerability in V8. Named [HashWick](https://darksi.de/12.hashwick-v8-vulnerability/), this vulnerability will need to be addressed by Node.js, but as yet has not been patched. This article will cover the details surrounding the disclosure yesterday, and explain some of the technical background. As a patch for Node.js is not yet available, I will also present some mitigation options for users and discuss how this vulnerability is likely to be addressed by Node.js.

**How to extract a data-rich service from a monolith**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/extract-data-rich-service.html#Step8.PointNewServiceToTheNewDatabase  
When breaking monoliths into smaller services, the hardest part is actually breaking up the data that lives in the database of the monolith. To extract a such a service, it is useful to follow a series of steps which retain a single write-copy of the data at all times. The steps begin by making a logical separation in the existing monolith: splitting service behavior into a separate module, then separating data into a separate table. These elements can be separately moved into a new autonomous service.

**I don't want to learn your garbage query language**  
https://erikbern.com/2018/08/30/i-dont-want-to-learn-your-garbage-query-language.html  
I just want my SQL back. It’s a language everyone understands, it’s been around since the seventies, and it’s reasonably standardized. It’s easy to read, and can be used by anyone, from business people to engineers. Instead, I have to learn a bunch of garbage query languages because everyone keeps trying to reinvent the wheel. DSL 的问题在前端也是存在的，虽然 HTML、JS、CSS 本身的描述能力已经是非常好了。

**Java's new Z Garbage Collector (ZGC) is very exciting**  
https://www.opsian.com/blog/javas-new-zgc-is-very-exciting/

The release contains a brand new Garbage Collector, ZGC, which is being developed by Oracle that promises very low pause times on multi-terabyte heaps. In this article we’ll cover the motivation for a new GC, a technical overview and some of the really exciting possibilities ZGC opens up.

**Go 2 Draft Designs**  
https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/go2draft.md  
As part of the Go 2 design process, we’ve published these draft designs to start community discussions about three topics: generics, error handling, and error value semantics. These draft designs are not proposals in the sense of the Go proposal process. They are starting points for discussion, with an eventual goal of producing designs good enough to be turned into actual proposals. 另附：[Go 1.11 is released(https://blog.golang.org/go1.11)、[Go 1.11 and beyond](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EwuJhEHR5Trr2aXBPQajZ2Hcoh29tm_LQCpgfrCnuRk/edit#slide=id.g33148270ac_0_143)、[GopherJS 1.11–1 is released](https://medium.com/gopherjs/gopherjs-1-11-1-is-released-7aad12f7e646)、[Announcing Project Athens and GopherSource for the Go community](https://open.microsoft.com/2018/08/28/announcing-project-athens-gophersource-go-community/).
