**Announcing Dart 2: Optimized for Client-Side Development**  
https://medium.com/dartlang/announcing-dart-2-80ba01f43b6   
With Dart 2, we’ve dramatically strengthened and streamlined the type system, cleaned up the syntax, and rebuilt much of the developer tool chain from the ground up to make mobile and web development more enjoyable and productive. Dart 2 also incorporates lessons learned from early adopters of the language including Flutter, AdWords, and AdSense, as well as thousands of improvements big and small in response to customer feedback.

**Exploring ES2018 and ES2019**  
http://exploringjs.com/es2018-es2019/  
This book is about two versions of JavaScript: ECMAScript 2018 and ECMAScript 2019 It only covers what’s new in those versions. 另附：[Using Promise.prototype.finally in Node.js](http://thecodebarbarian.com/using-promise-finally-in-node-js.html)

**Introducing Storage Access API**  
https://webkit.org/blog/8124/introducing-storage-access-api/  
In June last year we introduced [Intelligent Tracking Prevention](https://webkit.org/blog/7675/intelligent-tracking-prevention/) (ITP). ITP is a privacy feature that detects which domains have the ability to track the user cross-site and either partitions the domain’s cookies or purges its website data all together. The strongest developer feedback we got on ITP was that it needs to provide a way for embedded cross-site content to authenticate users who are already logged in to their first-party services. Today we are happy to provide a solution in the form of Storage Access API. It allows for authenticated embeds while continuing to protect customers’ privacy by default.

**Elm changed my mind about unpopular languages**  
https://blog.realkinetic.com/elm-changed-my-mind-about-unpopular-languages-190a23f4a834  
This is way better than Javascript. First, Elm has the natural predictability of a pure functional language; when you write Elm, the compiler forces you to consider every case. The second reason that Elm is better than Javascript is that Elm is a natural fit for the DOM. 

**Bringing Together React, D3, And Their Ecosystem**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/react-d3-ecosystem/  
In this post, we will see how we can approach building React projects that need the powerful charting goodness of D3. We will discover different techniques and how to choose the best library for your needs in your main work and side projects.

**Authentication Best Practices for Vue**  
https://blog.sqreen.io/authentication-best-practices-vue/  
Whenever you start to get serious with a project, you will most likely face the issues of how to handle client-side token-based authentication. You will have to answer these questions: How do I store my user’s token? How do I redirect the user after authentication actions ( Login/ Logout )? How do I prevent route access to authenticated and unauthenticated users? This article will walk you through these questions and try to illustrate with clear code and good practices in mind. 另附：[Vue Enterprise Boilerplate](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/vue-enterprise-boilerplate) - An ever-evolving, very opinionated architecture and dev environment for new Vue SPA projects using Vue CLI 3; [NativeScript-Vue 1.0](https://www.nativescript.org/blog/announcing-nativescript-vue-1.0) - Truly native apps using Vue.js and NativeScript.

**精读《Rekit Studio》**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/33853805  
以前，我们不断完善前端基础设施建设，现在前端不缺工具和库了，下一步怎么发展？发展方向有很多，比如继续完善框架和库、争论数据流的取舍、推动 ECMA 规范打造未来蓝图、投入新语言的怀抱、可视化规范与平台的建设等等。有一个没啥技术含量的领域正在成长，就是前端工具链整合。有人走在更前面，Rekit Studio，就是根据文件结构解析出逻辑结构的工具，让开发以逻辑结构管理项目，真的可能带来项目维护、开发成本的大幅优化。另附：[精读《React's new Context API》](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/33989091)

**How to JavaScript in 2018**  
https://www.telerik.com/blogs/how-to-javascript-in-2018  
From command-line tools and webpack to TypeScript, Flow and beyond, let's talk about how to use JavaScript in 2018. This blog post is part of our whitepaper, "[The Future of JavaScript: 2018 and Beyond](https://www.telerik.com/campaigns/kendo-ui/wp-javascript-future-2018)", which offers our future-looking analysis and predictions about the latest in JavaScript.

**Code Migration in Production: Rewriting the Sharding Layer of Uber’s Schemaless Datastore**  
https://eng.uber.com/schemaless-rewrite/  
In this article, we discuss how we migrated the Schemaless sharding layer from Python to Go, a process that enabled us to handle more traffic with less resources and led to improved user experiences across our services.

**Introducing HTTP/2 Server Push with NGINX 1.13.9**  
https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-1-13-9-http2-server-push/  
Server push can be used to prime a client with style sheets, images, and other resources that it will need to render a web page. You should take care to only push resources that are required; don’t push resources that a client is likely to already have cached.

**Go += Package Versioning**  
https://research.swtch.com/vgo  
In short, we need to add package versioning, but we need to do it without breaking go get. This post sketches a proposal for doing exactly that, along with a prototype demonstration that you can try today and that hopefully will be the basis for eventual go command integration. I intend this post to be the start of a productive discussion about what works and what doesn't. 

**A Programmable Programming Language**  
https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext  
Our decision to develop a new language—Racket—is partly an historical artifact and partly due to our desire to free ourselves from any unnecessary constraints of industrial mainstream languages as we investigate LOP. The next section spells out how Racket got started, how we honed in on LOP, and what the idea of LOP implies.

**7 Practical Tips for Cheating at Design**  
https://medium.com/refactoring-ui/7-practical-tips-for-cheating-at-design-40c736799886  
Improving your designs with tactics instead of talent.
Every web developer inevitably runs into situations where they need to make visual design decisions, whether they like it or not. Maybe the company you work for doesn’t have a full-time designer and you need to implement the UI for a new feature on your own. Or maybe you’re hacking on a side-project and you want it to look better than yet-another-Bootstrap-site. Here are seven simple ideas you can use to improve your designs today.

**Designing for Goals**  
https://uxplanet.org/designing-for-goals-a62cd4bd66e  
Good design is goal-based. If your product helps people with one or more of their goals, they will likely see value in it. If you do this better/cheaper than other products, you may have a successful product on your hands. 另附：[How to Save UI Designers & Front-End Developers up to 50% of Their Time](https://medium.com/sketch-app-sources/how-to-save-ui-designers-front-end-developers-up-to-50-of-their-time-ee2a5f819a3c)

https://blog.google/products/google-vr/announcing-arcore-10-and-new-updates-google-lens/
With ARCore and Google Lens, we’re working to make smartphone cameras smarter. ARCore enables developers to build apps that can understand your environment and place objects and information in it. Google Lens uses your camera to help make sense of what you see, whether that’s automatically creating contact information from a business card before you lose it, or soon being able to identify the breed of a cute dog you saw in the park. At Mobile World Congress, we're launching ARCore 1.0 along with new support for developers, and we’re releasing updates for Lens and rolling it out to more people.

**Working remotely, 4 years in**  
https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/02/18/working-remotely--4-years-in/  
It obviously hasn’t always been 100% perfect in every way, but working remotely has been a great career move for me. I’ve learned a ton from my coworkers and have been able to do some really cool projects that I’m proud of. So here are some thoughts about what I think has made it work for me. As usual this isn’t advice, and I’m not saying that you should work remotely. 

**The business of SaaS**  
https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/business-of-saas  
Understand why SaaS businesses work and how to grow them. If you are a software entrepreneur, and you do not sell mobile applications (which have a separate billing model, imposed by the platforms’ app stores), you should thoroughly understand the business of SaaS. This will let you make better decisions for your product (and company), allow you to see business-threatening problems months or years in advance of them being obvious, and help you in communicating with investors.

到目前为止，区块链还没有任何应用达到千万或者上亿用户的。这应该是区块链价值实现的一个基本标准。在这个意义上今天我们肯定还处于区块链前商业期。大部分关于区块链未来伟大前景的讨论还只是猜想而已。

**比尔·盖茨：我和梅琳达的第10封年度公开信**  
https://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309404207026396909735  
​​​我们一直坦言自己具备乐观精神。不过如今，乐观精神似乎十分稀缺。 所谓乐观，并非认识到过去不如现在，而是知道如何使生活得到改善。这才是我们乐观情绪的真正源泉。虽然在工作中见到过许多疾病与贫穷，也面临着许多亟待解决的重大问题，但我们也看到了人性最美好的一面。我们向发明尖端工具治疗疾病的科学家讨教，与不遗余力地用创新方式为全世界人类谋取健康与福祉的政府领导交谈，也在世界各地见到过勇敢而睿智的个体通过发挥想象力，找到彻底改变社区状况的新方法。当有人问 “你们怎么这么乐观？”时，我们的回应便是这样的。越来越多的人问我们这个问题，我们相信自己的回答在很大程度上反映了我们对世界的看法。这是我们的第十封年度公开信，为表纪念，我们准备回答常被问到的10个难题。我们会尽可能坦率地回答，也希望各位在读完后能像我们一样乐观。​

完成年轻群体的支付习惯与理念的重塑对于QQ来说只是一个开始，仅从历年来完美糅合了社交意味和支付属性的春节红包玩法大获成功来看，未来QQ支付还将与更多社交场景结合，未来是属于年轻人的，自然也是属于那些获得年轻人拥护的商业生态的。
